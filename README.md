# Flask Matrix Blog 🟢

A Matrix-inspired Flask web application designed to explore both the fundamentals and advanced features of the Flask framework.
The project combines storytelling, animations, and authentication with a fully functional blog system where only the admin can manage posts.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Flask and share practical knowledge about web development and programming.

# Concept 🧠

**The blog experience is inspired by The Matrix:**

• Users begin with an interactive intro featuring messages from Morpheus

• A white bunny appears and opens a portal into the “system”

**The entire interface follows a Matrix aesthetic:**

• neon green typography

• dark theme UI

• glitch, flicker, glow and pulse animations
